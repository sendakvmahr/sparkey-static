                                His name was Joe. He was just an average worker, like all the others. Today was just a normal day, like all the others. Joe was dispatched along with the others to site 99, a new excavation that their company has discovered. There was an opening in the rafters, up where the walls met the heavens. One day a stray scout had climbed over and up, and came back with incredible news. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                "There I beheld twin silver bowls with piles of crumbling treats, covered with sweet aromas that tickled my antennae! I came back immediately, oh, but imagine what else there is left to be discovered!" The company had acted at once. And now Joe was now part of the supply train that ferried resources back to their base. This was his fifth trip back to the food source that day, and he had just clambered through the opening in the rafters, where some of the others were now calling "The Breach".
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                "Hey Sam," Joe said to a familiar face, headed back the other way.
                                <br/>
                                "Hey Joe," said Sam. He had his head down due to the heavy load he was shouldering, but he glanced quickly at Joe and managed a quick smile. He moved on, disappearing down the Breach. Joe kept walking, making polite greetings with people he recognized along the way. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                The new world was strange to Joe. He had lived his life somewhere very dark, but that was a realization that only came after he had stepped out through the Breach. He had always thought life was just like that, devoid of light, and he was fine with it; he lived in it, laughed in it, worked in it. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But this new world was awash with light. His eyes could see far and the world seemed strangely hollow to him, where he felt he had been embedded in darkness for all his life. He couldn't quite decide if he liked it, so he tried not to think about it so much. He just kept his eyes on the person infront of him and did his job. They rounded a corner and soon they were upon the silver bowls. Their company had been at it all day but it seems that there were an endless amount for them to take. The breakers had been hard at work, breaking the big, round spheres into smaller portions for the supply train to take. Up ahead, Curt and a guy he didn't recognize was standing on the rim of the silver bowl closest to Joe, lowering crumbs to the supply line underneath them. Joe didn't have to wait long, everybody knew what to do and everything happened quickly.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                "Hey Joe," Curt said as he passed Joe a big crumb. But at that moment, the silver bowl started to rise into the air, a few yards away, the other bowl did the same. Joe was frozen, staring widely. Curt clutched tightly to the rim of the bowl and the crumb he was holding fell. It was a long fall, because the bowls had risen so fast, yanked up into the sky and if Curt had screamed, Joe didn't hear anything, the bowls were already gone, hidden behind a mountain that had legs, the mountain that is stomping away, carrying Curt and the others. Joe turned around, staring speechlessly at the people behind him. Terror was breaking across their faces. A little farther back, at the bend that they had rounded, workers that came up through the Breach was bumping into the people that had stopped in their tracks. The moment burst and the workers started to run back towards the breach, towards safety, pushing and shouting at the newcomers to move out of the way, to get back down, that it was dangerous here. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                Joe stood still and looked down from where he had stepped up to meet Curt. He saw his friends and coworkers shoving each other, a frenzied tide overpowering those who stood still in confusion, forcing everyone back the other way. Joe heard the stomps of the mountain before it appeared in view. Two swinging pillars descending from the sky, moving horrifying fast for something so large, it moved, no, it was already past the bend and out of sight. The mountain was blocked from view, but Joe knew that the mountain was at the Breach, he waited without realizing that he had stopped breathing. The people below were still shoving each other, they did not notice the mountain and could not hear it's passing over the cacophony they were sounding. Joe strained his ears and time seemed to slow, and over the cries of his people, came another sound, an insidious hiss that cut through the air and silenced the words in the throats of his coworkers. Everyone stopped moving. All heads on this side of the bend were fixed, staring in the direction of the Breach, imagining what was causing that sound as if they could see through the walls. Suddenly, the hissing stopped. The mountain appeared over the bend, it was crouched and holding something. A huge, cylindrical structure was aimed at the people clumped together, the moment stretched into infinity as the masses stared up into the face of the alien object, held mere yards away from their upturned faces, and then the world was engulfed in the hiss once more, from the mouth of the structure came a strong spray of toxic mist, covering the others in liquid and striking them lifeless on the spot. Joe watched, he didn't have time to feel fear, it happened so fast. Where there were screaming, shouting people before, now there was nothing. Just bodies covered with poisonous water, bodies drowned in poison that covered the faces of people he used to know. Somehow, the hateful structure had stopped before it reached Joe, if he was not paralyzed both in body and mind, he would have realized that he was spared because he stood atop the stand where the silver bowls were once entrenched. And he was an insignificant thing, overlooked by the mountain that moved, the mountain that killed.                            </p>
